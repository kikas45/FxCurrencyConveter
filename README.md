Introducing **Currency Converter App** 📱💱

This is a simple yet efficient **Currency Converter App** built using **Jetpack Compose**, **Dagger Hilt**, **MVVM Architecture**, **Room Database**, and **Kotlin Coroutines**.

### Features:
- Clean and modern UI with **Jetpack Compose**
- Dependency Injection using **Dagger Hilt**
- Offline support with **Room Database**
- Real-time currency exchange rates fetched from **Fixer.io API**
- Asynchronous operations powered by **Kotlin Coroutines**

### How It Works:
The app fetches exchange rates from Fixer.io API and performs simple currency conversions.

### Important Note ⚠️:
Fixer.io API has a **limited number of free requests**. If you encounter an error or the conversion result shows **0.000**, it means the API request limit has been reached.
